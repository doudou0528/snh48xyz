# snh48.xyz

SNH48 Group index for content with subtitles

## Quick start

```
npm install
npm run develop
```

## Project Structure

Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/)

- `src/` - all the source code for the website
  - `src/components/layout.js` - the parent layout for all pages on the site
  - `src/components/content_*.js` - components for displaying content items
  - `src/pages/` - individual pages
  - `src/templates/` - templates for pages automatically generated from content
- `content/` - YAML + JSON sources for all the content on the website

Pages are generated in `gatsby-node.js`

### Styling

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and [Twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) ([TailwindCSS](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs)) are both included. Global styles go in `src/styles/global.css`.

### Contribute

See issues tab. Create a new branch, make changes, and open a pull request. The website is automatically compiled and updated whenever this repo is updated.

#### Adding Content

Edit the YAML file in `content` with the following information. 

```
- name: "test"
  type: "Variety"
  date: 2021-02-19
  language: "English"
  link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBuxvfO32zo"
  groups: ["SNH48"]
  teams: ["HII"]
  members: ["fill", "this", "in", "later"]
```

#### Updating members

The `members.json` file and member images are generated by running scripts in [snh48xyz_tools](https://github.com/doudou0528/snh48xyz_tools). The group, team, and member pages are then generated by taking the member and content files as input.

#### Note on Language

Anybody can submit content in any language, not just English. The site itself is in English because I figured it's easy to right click + translate site if anyone wants to view it in another language. If anyone wants to tackle internationalizing the site, that would be a welcome contribution.

#### Join as a Contributor on GitHub

If you want to push directly to the repo instead of opening a PR each time (for example, you're regularly adding content), DM [@doudou_0528](https://twitter.com/doudou_0528) on Twitter.
